            <h2>Spirited Away</h2>
            <p>Spirited Away is a movie by Studio Ghibli</p>
            <p>
                I like this movie because it has a good story
                and also has many lessons that you can learn from it.

            <h2>Interstellar</h2>
            <p>Interstellar is a futuristic movie made by Christopher Nolan</p>
            <p>
                I like the movie because it shows how gravity and outer space works
                very realistically. They even used programming to display a black hole.

            <h2>Tenet</h2>
            <p>Tenet is made by the same director as Interstellar</p>
            <p>
                I like Tenet because it is the first movie that I have seen where
                time is flowing both forward and backward in a scene. This is a very
                new thing in movies that I want to see more of.
